Capital letters are generally only used in the first letter of a sentence.
Plural and singular are not used, the words are always spelled the same.
The special alphabet is used for traditional namings.
The word mat (is) is not always needed when it can be derived from another word, for example: "Nepoy ko netap" (where they from) does not need mat.
According to the locative grammar rule "Into" would become "Termiha"
Re- becomes rój (again) as last particle. Example: natihélirój (recreated)
The head noun is positioned after the modifier in compounds (e.g. kebo-huwal, venusgrad yalaríhul)
Languages or countries are as they are natively, with -ka where required (f.e. english -> english(-ka))
Directional names usually end in -ka (f.e. East Porpoistan Metro -> Híjuro-ka Porpoistan Metro)
